# RoadSign_TL

The thesis consists of a study of the performance of Transfer Learning (TL) in the problem of automatic traffic sign recognition. The problem of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), which is used in modern vehicles, and the usefulness of sign detection for the development of autonomous cars were discussed. The project used the Belgium Traffic Sign Dataset, from which 30 traffic sign classes were filtered, which were divided into training and validation collection. Existing VGG-16 and MobileNet architectures were used to create TL models, and then 72 models were created based on different parameters of the learning algorithms. Next an evaluation of the results was performed using such parameters as overall accuracy, F1 macro Score, confusion matrices. Influence of the size of the dataset, selected algorithm parameters on the results was investigated. An analysis of the accuracy for each character class was also performed, and the results were discussed and a perspective on the use of TL models in TSR systems was presented. The Python programming language and the Keras interface for the TensorFlow library were used to process the data, train and validate the network
